            <summary>
            This is a C# port of a Java port of GNU getopt, a class for parsing
            command line arguments passed to programs. It it based on the C
            getopt() functions in glibc 2.0.6 and should parse options in a 100%
            compatible manner. If it does not, that is a bug. The programmer's
            interface is also very compatible.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            To use Getopt, create a Getopt object with a args array passed to the
            main method, then call the <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> method in a loop. It
            will return an <see cref="T:System.Int32"/> that contains the value of the option
            character parsed from the command line. When there are no more options
            to be parsed, it returns -1.
            <para>
            A command line option can be defined to take an argument. If an option
            has an argument, the value of that argument is stored in an instance
            variable called <c>optarg</c>, which can be accessed using the
            <see cref="P:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.Optarg"/> property.
            If an option that requires an argument is found, but there is no
            argument present, then an error message is printed. Normally
            <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> returns a '<c>?</c>' in this situation, but that
            can be changed as described below.
            </para>
            <para>
            If an invalid option is encountered, an error message is printed to
            the standard error and <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> returns a '<c>?</c>'.
            The value of the invalid option encountered is stored in the instance
            variable optopt which can be retrieved using the <see cref="P:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.Optopt"/>
            property.
            To suppress the printing of error messages for this or any other error,
            set the value of the <c>opterr</c> instance variable to false using the
            <see cref="P:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.Opterr"/> property.
            </para>
            <para>
            Between calls to <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/>, the instance variable
            <c>optind</c> is used to keep track of where the object is in the
            parsing process. After all options have been returned, <c>optind</c>
            is the index in argv of the first non-option argument.
            This variable can be accessed with the <see cref="P:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.Optind"/> property.
            </para>
            <para>
            Note that this object expects command line options to be passed in the
            traditional Unix manner. That is, proceeded by a '<c>-</c>' character.
            Multiple options can follow the '<c>-</c>'. For example "<c>-abc</c>"
            is equivalent to "<c>-a -b -c</c>". If an option takes a required
            argument, the value of the argument can immediately follow the option
            character or be present in the next argv element. For example,
            "<c>-cfoo</c>" and "<c>-c foo</c>" both represent an option character
            of '<c>c</c>' with an argument of "<c>foo</c>" assuming <c>c</c> takes
            a required argument.
            If an option takes an argument that is not required, then any argument
            must immediately follow the option character in the same argv element.
            For example, if c takes a non-required argument, then "<c>-cfoo</c>"
            represents option character '<c>c</c>' with an argument of "<c>foo</c>"
            while "<c>-c foo</c>" represents the option character '<c>c</c>' with
            no argument, and a first non-option argv element of "<c>foo</c>".
            </para>
            <para>
            The user can stop <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> from scanning any further into
            a command line by using the special argument "<c>--</c>" by itself.
            For example:
            "<c>-a -- -d</c>" would return an option character of '<c>a</c>', then
            return -1.
            The "<c>--</c>" is discarded and "<c>-d</c>" is pointed to by
            <c>optind</c> as the first non-option argv element.
            </para>
            <example>
            Here is a basic example of using Getopt:
            <code>
            Getopt g = new Getopt("testprog", args, "ab:c::d");
            
            int c;
            string arg;
            while ((c = g.getopt()) != -1)
            {
            	switch(c)
            	{
            		case 'a':
            		case 'd':
            			Console.WriteLine("You picked " + (char)c );
            			break;
            				
            		case 'b':
            		case 'c':
            			arg = g.Optarg;
            			Console.WriteLine("You picked " + (char)c + 
            				" with an argument of " +
            				((arg != null) ? arg : "null") );
            			break;
            
            		case '?':
            			break; // getopt() already printed an error
            
            		default:
            			Console.WriteLine("getopt() returned " + c);
            			break;
            	}
            }
            </code>
            In this example, a new Getopt object is created with three params. The
            first param is the program name. This is for printing error messages in
            the form "program: error message". In the C version, this value is
            taken from argv[0], but in .NET the program name is not passed in that
            element, thus the need for this parameter. The second param is the
            argument list that was passed to the main() method. The third param is
            the list of valid options. Each character represents a valid option. If
            the character is followed by a single colon, then that option has a
            required argument. If the character is followed by two colons, then
            that option has an argument that is not required.
            <para>
            Note in this example that the value returned from <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/>
            is cast to a char prior to printing. This is required in order to make
            the value display correctly as a character instead of an integer.
            </para>
            </example>
            If the first character in the option string is a colon, for example
            "<c>:abc::d</c>", then <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> will return a '<c>:</c>'
            instead of a '<c>?</c>' when it encounters an option with a missing
            required argument. This allows the caller to distinguish between
            invalid options and valid options that are simply incomplete.
            <para>
            In the traditional Unix getopt(), -1 is returned when the first
            non-option charcter is encountered. In GNU getopt(), the default
            behavior is to allow options to appear anywhere on the command line.
            The <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> method permutes the argument to make it appear
            to the caller that all options were at the beginning of the command
            line, and all non-options were at the end. For example, calling
            <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> with command line argv of "<c>-a foo bar -d</c>"
            returns options '<c>a</c>' and '<c>d</c>', then sets optind to point to
            "<c>foo</c>". The program would read the last two argv elements as
            "<c>foo</c>" and "<c>bar</c>", just as if the user had typed
            "<c>-a -d foo bar</c>". 
            </para>
            <para> 
            The user can force <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> to stop scanning the command
            line with the special argument "<c>--</c>" by itself. Any elements
            occuring before the "<c>--</c>" are scanned and permuted as normal. Any
            elements after the "<c>--</c>" are returned as is as non-option argv
            elements. For example, "<c>foo -a -- bar -d</c>" would return option
            '<c>a</c>' then -1. <c>optind</c> would point  to "<c>foo</c>",
            "<c>bar</c>" and "<c>-d</c>" as the non-option argv elements. The
            "<c>--</c>" is discarded by <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            There are two ways this default behavior can be modified. The first is
            to specify traditional Unix getopt() behavior (which is also POSIX
            behavior) in which scanning stops when the first non-option argument
            encountered. (Thus "<c>-a foo bar -d</c>" would return '<c>a</c>' as an
            option and have "<c>foo</c>", "<c>bar</c>", and "<c>-d</c>" as
            non-option elements).
            The second is to allow options anywhere, but to return all elements in
            the order they occur on the command line.
            When a non-option element is ecountered, an integer 1 is returned and
            the value of the non-option element is stored in <c>optarg</c> is if
            it were the argument to that option.
            For example, "<c>-a foo -d</c>", returns first '<c>a</c>', then 1 (with
            <c>optarg</c> set to "<c>foo</c>") then '<c>d</c>' then -1.
            When this "return in order" functionality is enabled, the only way to
            stop <c>getopt</c> from scanning all command line elements is to
            use the special "<c>--</c>" string by itself as described above. An
            example is "<c>-a foo -b -- bar</c>", which would return '<c>a</c>',
            then integer 1 with <c>optarg</c> set to "<c>foo</c>", then '<c>b</c>',
            then -1.
            <c>optind</c> would then point to "<c>bar</c>" as the first non-option
            argv element. The "<c>--</c>" is discarded.
            </para>
            <para>
            The POSIX/traditional behavior is enabled by either setting the 
            application setting "Gnu.PosixlyCorrect" or by putting a '<c>+</c>'
            sign as the first character of the option string.
            The difference between the two methods is that setting the
            "Gnu.PosixlyCorrect" application setting also forces certain error
            messages to be displayed in POSIX format.
            To enable the "return in order" functionality, put a '<c>-</c>' as the
            first character of the option string. Note that after determining the
            proper behavior, Getopt strips this leading '<c>+</c>' or '<c>-</c>',
            meaning that a '<c>:</c>' placed as the second character after one of
            those two will still cause <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> to return a '<c>:</c>'
            instead of a '<c>?</c>' if a required option argument is missing.
            </para>
            <para>
            In addition to traditional single character options, GNU Getopt also
            supports long options. These are preceeded by a "<c>--</c>" sequence
            and can be as long as desired. Long options provide a more
            user-friendly way of entering command line options.
            For example, in addition to a "<c>-h</c>" for help, a program could
            support also "<c>--help</c>".
            </para>
            <para>
            Like short options, long options can also take a required or
            non-required argument. Required arguments can either be specified by
            placing an equals sign after the option name, then the argument, or by
            putting the argument in the next argv element. For example:
            "<c>--outputdir=foo</c>" and "<c>--outputdir foo</c>" both represent an
            option of "<c>outputdir</c>" with an argument of "<c>foo</c>", assuming
            that outputdir takes a required argument. If a long option takes a
            non-required argument, then the equals sign form must be used to
            specify the argument. In this case, "<c>--outputdir=foo</c>" would
            represent option outputdir with an argument of <c>foo</c> while
            "<c>--outputdir foo</c>" would represent the option outputdir with no
            argument and a first non-option argv element of "<c>foo</c>".
            </para>
            <para>
            Long options can also be specified using a special POSIX argument
            format (one that I highly discourage). This form of entry is enabled by
            placing a "<c>W;</c>" (yes, '<c>W</c>' then a semi-colon) in the valid
            option string.
            This causes getopt to treat the name following the "<c>-W</c>" as the
            name of the long option. For example, "<c>-W outputdir=foo</c>" would
            be equivalent to "<c>--outputdir=foo</c>". The name can immediately
            follow the "<c>-W</c>" like so: "<c>-Woutputdir=foo</c>".
            Option arguments are handled identically to normal long options. If a
            string follows the "<c>-W</c>" that does not represent a
            valid long option, then <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> returns '<c>W</c>' and
            the caller must decide what to do. Otherwise <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/>
            returns a long option value as described below.
            </para>
            <para>
            While long options offer convenience, they can also be tedious to type
            in full. So it is permissible to abbreviate the option name to as few
            characters as required to uniquely identify it. If the name can
            represent multiple long options, then an error message is printed and
            <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> returns a '<c>?</c>'.  
            </para>
            <para>
            If an invalid option is specified or a required option argument is 
            missing, <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> prints an error and returns a '<c>?</c>'
            or '<c>:</c>' exactly as for short options.
            Note that when an invalid long option is encountered, the <c>optopt</c>
            variable is set to integer 0 and so cannot be used to identify the
            incorrect option the user entered.
            </para>
            <para>
            Long options are defined by <see cref="T:Gnu.Getopt.LongOpt"/> objects. These
            objects are created with a contructor that takes four params: a string
            representing the object name, a integer specifying what arguments the
            option takes (the value is one of the <see cref="T:Gnu.Getopt.Argument"/>
            enumeration: <see cref="F:Gnu.Getopt.Argument.No"/>,
            <see cref="F:Gnu.Getopt.Argument.Required"/>, or <see cref="F:Gnu.Getopt.Argument.Optional"/>),
            a <see cref="T:System.Text.StringBuilder"/> flag object (described
            below), and an integer value (described below).
            </para>
            <para>
            To enable long option parsing, create an array of
            <see cref="T:Gnu.Getopt.LongOpt"/>'s representing the legal options and pass it to
            the Getopt() constructor.
            WARNING: If all elements of the array are not populated with
            <see cref="T:Gnu.Getopt.LongOpt"/> objects, the <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> method will
            throw a <see cref="T:System.NullReferenceException"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            When <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> is called and a long option is encountered,
            one of two things can be returned.
            If the flag field in the <see cref="T:Gnu.Getopt.LongOpt"/> object representing the
            long option is non-null, then the integer value field is stored there
            and an integer 0 is returned to the caller.
            The <c>val</c> field can then be retrieved from the <c>flag</c> field.
            Note that since the <c>flag</c> field is a
            <see cref="T:System.Text.StringBuilder"/>, the appropriate string to
            integer converions must be performed in order to get the actual int
            value stored there.
            If the <c>flag</c> field in the <see cref="T:Gnu.Getopt.LongOpt"/> object is null,
            then the value field of the <see cref="T:Gnu.Getopt.LongOpt"/> is returned.
            This can be the character of a short option.
            This allows an app to have both a long and short option sequence (say,
            "<c>-h</c>" and "<c>--help</c>") that do the exact same thing.
            </para>
            <para>
            With long options, there is an alternative method of determining which
            option was selected. The property Longind will return the index in the
            long option array (NOT argv) of the long option found. So if multiple
            long options are configured to return the same value, the application
            can use <see cref="P:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.Longind"/> to distinguish between them. 
            </para>
            <example>
            Here is an expanded Getopt example using long options and various
            techniques described above:
            <code>
            int c;
            string arg;
            LongOpt[] longopts = new LongOpt[3];
            
            StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
            longopts[0] = new LongOpt("help", LongOpt.NO_ARGUMENT, null, 'h');
            longopts[1] = new LongOpt("outputdir", LongOpt.REQUIRED_ARGUMENT, sb, 'o'); 
            longopts[2] = new LongOpt("maximum", LongOpt.OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT, null, 2);
            
            Getopt g = new Getopt("testprog", argv, "-:bc::d:hW;", longopts);
            g.Opterr = false; // We'll do our own error handling

            <para>
            There is an alternative form of the constructor used for long options
            above. This takes a trailing boolean flag. If set to false, Getopt
            performs identically to the example, but if the boolean flag is true
            then long options are allowed to start with a single '<c>-</c>' instead
            of "<c>--</c>". If the first character of the option is a valid short
            option character, then the option is treated as if it were the short
            option. Otherwise it behaves as if the option is a long option.
            Note that the name given to this option - <c>longOnly</c> - is very
            counter-intuitive.
            It does not cause only long options to be parsed but instead enables
            the behavior described above.

             The special argument "<c>--</c>" forces an end of option-scanning

             ReturnInOrder, only <c>--</c> can cause <see cref="M:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.getopt"/> to

            RequireOrder means don't recognize them as options; stop option
            processing when the first non-option is seen. This is what Unix
            does. This mode of operation is selected by either setting the
            application setting Gnu.PosixlyCorrect, or using '<c>+</c>' as
            the first character of the list of option characters.

            Permute is the default. We permute the contents of ARGV as we
            scan, so that eventually all the non-options are at the end.
            This allows options to be given in any order, even with
            programs that were not written to expect this.

            written to expect options and other ARGV-elements in any order
            and that care about the ordering of the two. We describe each
            non-option ARGV-element as if it were the argument of an option
            with character code 1. Using '<c>-</c>' as the first character
            of the list of option characters selects this mode of
            operation.

            <summary>
            This method returns a char that is the current option that has been
            parsed from the command line. If the option takes an argument, then
            the internal variable <c>optarg</c> is set which is a string
            representing the the value of the argument. This value can be
            retrieved by the caller using the <see cref="P:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.Optarg"/> property. If
            an invalid option is found, an error message is printed and a
            '<c>?</c>' is returned.
            The name of the invalid option character can be retrieved by
            calling the <c>Optopt</c> property. When there are no more options
            to be scanned, this method returns -1. The index of first
            non-option element in argv can be retrieved with the
            <see cref="P:Gnu.Getopt.Getopt.Optind"/> property.
